REQUIREMENTS

The script uses the text editor ed to edit configuration files, so you may need to install it (some distros don't have it preinstalled). 


BOINC VERSIONS

Users of version less than 7.0.54 sould consider un upgrade to allow the use of --fetch_on_update option

At the time of writing (version 7.5.0) the maximum ncpus allowed is 64. See MAX_NCPUS variable in sched_config.cpp of the BOINC source code


LANGUAGE

All text in the script (output messages and comments) are written in italian. I don't know if I ever will translate it to english. 


WINDOWS USERS

Some adaptations has been made for execution under Cygwin on Windows. Briefly tested but seems work well.
The packages util-linux, procps, and ed are needed in addition to the base installation of Cygwin.

Due to the difference in the way Windows and Linux handle newline in text files is racommended to download the file directly from Cygwin.
You may want the package wget to download the file and the package dos4unix in case you have to deal with this problem.
